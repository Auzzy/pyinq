Introduction
============

PyInq is a unit test framework written in the tradition of the xUnit family. It draws much of its influence from PyUnit and JUnit. As such, there are many features shared between PyInq and these frameworks. However, PyInq differs in ways that I believe are in the best interest of the developer. Decorators are used for test dientification, the framework itself is implemented for use in a Pythonic fashion, and output is pretty and detailed, to name a few focal points.
